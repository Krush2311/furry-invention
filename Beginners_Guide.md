## For Creating pull request on github desktop 

#### Step 1. Fork the repository

Click on **Fork** to fork the parent repository to your account.

A GitHub fork is a copy of a repository (repo) that sits in your account rather than the account from which you forked the data from. Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repo.


#### Step 2. Commit changes

Make the changes you want to (in your forked repository and not the original one!) and click on **commit changes**

A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

#### Step 3. Creating pull request
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.

Once you have commited the changes, go to Pull request and click on **New Pull request**

After clicking, you'll be directed to following screen, Here click on **create pull request**.
