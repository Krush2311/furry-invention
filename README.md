# furry-invention
This repository aims to help beginners with their first contributions. We support both technical and non-technical contributions!

### We are aiming to publish a blog for beginners on getting started with their first contribution.

### The Idea is "For the beginners by the beginners"!
As the slogan suggests, we plan to accept contributions from **beginners** and with their help we'll be publishing the blog which will further help other beginners to get started with the contributions.

#### This repository will include issues on Translating, deigning, documentation, editing and few contributions for betterment of this repository.

### This repository is labelled "Hactoberfest" only to encourage more participation, but any kind of spamming will not be tolerated as we wolud be checking whether you are a beginner or not.  

If you are not a begginer and genuinely want to help, you can help by guiding the beginners!

We hope that this repository will help you,
## Happy Contributing!
